# Convert a Design To a Responsive Website 

The task was to develop a basic responsive website based on 2 images provided by the design team as a template. 

1 image shows the desired desktop layout and the other image shows the desired mobile view and resolution.

The only other requirement was to make the switch from desktop to mobile view at **768px**.

#### I successfully completed the task in VS Code writing the basic structure in HTML and formatting using CSS utilizing media queries to give the site mobile responsiveness.
